**Overview**

This repository contains content and functionality to help you install and try out the Cloud Deploy service. Currently, this service is not intended for production workloads—do not use it for any live applications.

The instructions included will guide you through creating a new project, provisioning an cluster to run the Experiment tooling, as well as three additional clusters to act as ‘staging’, 'test', and ‘production’ environments, in name only, to use as part of the Tutorial workflow.

The included Tutorial will then walk through steps to use the various tools and clusters to highlight specific features of this Experiment release.
