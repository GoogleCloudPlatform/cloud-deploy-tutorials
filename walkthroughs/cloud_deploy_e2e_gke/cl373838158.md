**Test > Staging > Production** delivery pipeline using Cloud Deploy:

1. Set up an example environment:
   1. Create a new Cloud project and clone a sample GKE configuration
   and application.

   1. Deploy the sample GKE clusters, which represent test, stage, and
   production environments.

   1. Build the sample application.

1. Create a delivery pipeline with three targets: test, staging, and prod.

1. Create the three pipeline targets.

1. Create a release to associate the current version of the sample application with
   the delivery pipeline.

   Creating the release automatically promotes the application to the test target.

1. Promote the release to staging.

1. Set up an approvals process so that only approved releases can be promoted to prod.

1. Promote the release to prod.

1. Clean up to avoid incurring charges to your account.

These steps show you how to work in a Cloud Shell Editor development
environment, but the process is same when you work in your own environment.

To get started, click **Start**.

## Set up a project and clone the sample code

_We recommend that you create a new project. You may experience undesired side effects if you use an existing project._

1. <walkthrough-project-setup></walkthrough-project-setup>

1. To clone the sample GKE cluster and application, click the following button:
   [![Setup Cloud Shell](https://walkthroughs.googleusercontent.com/content/cloud_deploy_e2e_gke/images/setup.png)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https://source.developers.google.com/p/clouddeploy-preview/r/clouddeploy-tutorials&cloudshell_git_branch=release-1.0&cloudshell_workspace=.&cloudshell_tutorial=walkthroughs/cloud_deploy_e2e_gke/cloud_deploy_e2e_gke.md)

To learn how to deploy the sample GKE clusters, click **Next**.

## Deploy the sample GKE clusters

1. To set a default region for the sample Cloud resources, enter the following
   command in the Cloud Shell Editor terminal: 

    ```bash
    gcloud config set deploy/region $(gcloud config get-value compute/region)
    ``` 
1. To deploy the sample GKE clusters into a Virtual Private Cloud in `{{project-id}}`:

    ```bash
    cd clouddeploy-tutorials
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ```

   This might take a few minutes to run. 

1. After the script finishes, confirm that your GKE clusters and supporting resources
   are properly deployed:

    ```bash
    gcloud container clusters list
    ```

If the command succeeds, each cluster will have three nodes and a `RUNNING` status:

```terminal
NAME     LOCATION     MASTER_VERSION    MASTER_IP       MACHINE_TYPE   NODE_VERSION      NUM_NODES  STATUS
prod     us-central1  1.17.17-gke.2800  35.194.37.64    n1-standard-2  1.17.17-gke.2800  3          RUNNING
staging  us-central1  1.17.17-gke.2800  35.232.139.69   n1-standard-2  1.17.17-gke.2800  3          RUNNING
test     us-central1  1.17.17-gke.2800  35.188.180.217  n1-standard-2  1.17.17-gke.2800  3          RUNNING
```

To learn how to build the sample application, click **Next**.

## Build a sample application

The sample application is a simple web app that responds to HTTP requests and adds a log entry. 

1. To create the container images and push them to Artifact Registry,
   run the following skaffold command:

    ```bash
    cd web && skaffold build --interactive=false --default-repo $(gcloud config get-value compute/region)-docker.pkg.dev/{{project-id}}/web-app --file-output artifacts.json && cd ..
    ```
    skaffold follows the build instructions in <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="tutorial/web/skaffold.yaml">skaffold.yaml</walkthrough-editor-open-file>.
    In this sample, the instructions tell skaffold to uses Cloud Build to build container images named `leeroy-web` and `leeroy-app`. 

1. To confirm that the images were successfully pushed to Artifact Registry:

    ```bash
    gcloud artifacts docker images list $(gcloud config get-value compute/region)-docker.pkg.dev/$(gcloud config get-value project)/web-app --include-tags --format json
    ```

    The output should look like this: 

    ```terminal
    Listing items under project {{project-id}}, location us-central1, repository web-app.

    [
    {
        "createTime": "2021-04-15T23:15:15.792959Z",
        "package": "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/{{project-id}}/web-app/leeroy-app",    
        "tags": "v1",
        "updateTime": "2021-04-15T23:15:15.792959Z",
        "version": "sha256:80d8a867b82eb402ebe5b48f972c65c2b4cf7657ab30b03dd7b0b21dfc4a6792"
    },
    {
        "createTime": "2021-04-15T23:15:27.320207Z",
        "package": "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/{{project-id}}/web-app/leeroy-web",
        "tags": "v1",
        "updateTime": "2021-04-15T23:15:27.320207Z",

    }
    ]
    ```
1. <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="tutorial/artifacts.json">Review the artifacts.json</walkthrough-editor-open-file> file that skaffold created. 

   You'll need data from that file in an upcoming step. 

To learn how to create a delivery pipeline, click **Next**.

## Create a delivery pipeline
 
1. Create the delivery pipeline: 

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy apply --file=clouddeploy-config/delivery-pipeline.yaml 
    ```
   The <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="tutorial/clouddeploy-config/delivery-pipeline.yaml">delivery-pipeline.yaml</walkthrough-editor-open-file> 
   specifies the configuration of the delivery pipeline.

1. Verify the delivery pipeline was created:

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy delivery-pipelines describe web-app
    ```

    The output should look like this:

    ```terminal
    Delivery Pipeline:
    createTime: '2021-05-04T20:10:05.892293560Z'

    updateTime: '2021-05-04T20:10:06.647329907Z'
    Targets:[]
    ```

You can also see the [details for your delivery pipeline](https://console.cloud.google.com/deploy/delivery-pipelines/us-central1/web-app?project={{project-id}}) in the GCP control panel.

To learn how to create the pipeline targets, click **Next**.

## Create the pipeline targets

In Cloud Deploy, a _target_ represents a GKE cluster where an application can be deployed as part of a delivery pipeline. 

1. To create the `test` target: 

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy apply --file clouddeploy-config/test-environment.yaml
    ```
    The <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="tutorial/clouddeploy-config/test-environment.yaml">test-environment.yaml</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
    file specifies the configuration of the target.

1. Create the `staging` target:

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy apply --file clouddeploy-config/staging-environment.yaml
    ```

1. Create the `prod` target:

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy apply --file clouddeploy-config/prod-environment.yaml
    ```

1. Verify the targets were created:

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy targets list --delivery-pipeline=web-app
    ```

    The output should look like this:

    ```terminal

    ```

To learn how to create a release, click **Next**.

## Create a release

A *release* is a specific version of one or more application images associated with a specific delivery pipeline.

1. To create a release, give the release a name (web-app-001) and specify a pipeline: 

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy releases create web-app-001 --delivery-pipeline web-app --build-artifacts web/artifacts.json --source web/
    ```
   The pipeline in this sample uses `skaffold` to build the container images. 

1. To confirm the release has been created: 

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy releases list --delivery-pipeline web-app
    ```

     The output provides a point-in-time reference that's used for the duration of the release: 

    ```terminal
    ---
    buildArtifacts:
    - imageName: leeroy-app
    tag: 'us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/{{project-id}}/web-app/leeroy-app:'
    - imageName: leeroy-web
    tag: 'us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/{{project-id}}/web-app/leeroy-web:'
    createTime: '2021-04-29T00:30:59.672965025Z'deliveryPipelineSnapshot:
    createTime: '1970-01-01T00:00:30.486775Z'
    description: web-app delivery pipeline
    etag: 2539eacd7f5c256d
    name: projects/619472186817/locations/us-central1/deliveryPipelines/web-app
    serialPipeline:
        stages:
        - targetId: test
        - targetId: staging
        - targetId: prod
    ```

1. When you create a release, the pipeline promotes your application to the first target. 
   To confirm the release was deployed to the test target:

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy rollouts list --delivery-pipeline web-app --release web-app-001
    ```

    Your output should look similar to this:

    ```terminal
    ---
    createTime: '2021-04-30T18:46:45.657293361Z'
    deployBuild: 3915c189-e9b4-4c6e-b757-322d8db18188
    deployEndTime: '2021-04-30T18:47:31.951451Z'
    deployStartTime: '2021-04-30T18:46:47.234151706Z'
    etag: d4a044da3c830258
    name: projects/{{project-id}}/locations/us-central1/deliveryPipelines/web-app/releases/web-app-001/rollouts/web-app-001-to-test-0002
    state: SUCCESS
    target: test
    uid: f37126ebe3764108beb081c7e2930d7a
    ```

1. To confirm your application was deployed to the test GKE cluster: 

    ```bash
    kubectx test
    kubectl get pods -n default
    ```

    The output of your `kubectl` command should look similar to the following: 

    ```terminal
    NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    leeroy-app-7b8d48f794-svl6g   1/1     Running   0          19s
    leeroy-web-5498c5b7fd-czvm8   1/1     Running   0          20s
    ```

To learn how to promote the release to the staging environment, click **Next**.

## Promote the release to staging

1. To promote the release to your staging target: 

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy releases promote --delivery-pipeline web-app --release web-app-001 --to-target staging
    ```

1. To confirm the release was deployed to the test target:

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy rollouts list --delivery-pipeline web-app --release web-app-001
    ```

    The output should include the following lines:

    ```terminal
    ...
    state: SUCCESS
    target: test

1. To confirm your application was deployed to the staging GKE cluster: 

    ```bash
    kubectx staging
    kubectl get pods -n default
    ```

    The output of your `kubectl` command should look similar to the following: 

    ```terminal
    NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    leeroy-app-7b8d48f794-svl6g   1/1     Running   0          19s
    leeroy-web-5498c5b7fd-czvm8   1/1     Running   0          20s
    ```

To learn how to require approval for promoting to the production target, click **Next**.

## Set up an approvals process

Requiring approval before promoting to a specific target prevents you from promoting releases before they are fully vetted.

1. To require approval, you specify the `approvalRequired`
   parameter in the pipeline configuration file.

   The <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="tutorial/clouddeploy-config/delivery-pipeline.yaml">delivery-pipeline.yaml</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
   for this sample already specifies this parameter for the prod target, but you
   can set up **any** target to require an approval.

1. To verify that approval is required for prod, run the following command and look for `approvalRequired` in the output:

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy targets describe prod --delivery-pipeline web-app
    ```

    Your output should look similar to this: 

    ```terminal
    Target:
    approvalRequired: true
    createTime: '2021-04-30T18:40:11.068571913Z'
    description: prod cluster
    etag: 74a0c6560ae0ace7
    gkeCluster:
        cluster: prod
        location: us-central1
        project: {{project-id}}
    name: projects/{{project-id}}/locations/us-central1/deliveryPipelines/web-app/targets/prod
    uid: 95fbe354bc07435f8248712a44035ca0
    updateTime: '2021-04-30T20:39:57.398607646Z'
    ```


### Defining approvers

Only users and service accounts with the `clouddeploy.approver` IAM role can approve promotions to targets that require approval. Using service accounts to grant approval is a typical workflow for anyone integrating Cloud Deploy into their CI/CD toolchain.

To demonstrate the approval process, create a service account and bind it to the `clouddeploy.approver` role:

1. Create a new service account: 

    ```bash
    gcloud iam service-accounts create pipeline-approver --display-name 'Web-App Pipeline Approver'
    ```

1. Confirm the service account was created:

    ```bash
    gcloud iam service-accounts list
    ```

    The output includes your new Approver Service Account as well as Service Accounts for each GKE cluster that were created with the bootstrap process. Note the `EMAIL` address for your new Approver service account. You'll need it in the next step.

    ```terminal
    DISPLAY NAME                            EMAIL                                                           DISABLED
    Cluster Service Account for test        tf-sa-test@{{project-id}}.iam.gserviceaccount.com         False
    Cluster Service Account for prod        tf-sa-prod@{{project-id}}.iam.gserviceaccount.com         False
    Cluster Service Account for staging     tf-sa-staging@{{project-id}}.iam.gserviceaccount.com      False
    Web-App Pipeline Approver               pipeline-approver@{{project-id}}.iam.gserviceaccount.com  False
    Compute Engine default service account  619472186817-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com              False
    ```

1. To bind the `clouddeploy.approver` role to your new Service Account: 

    ```bash
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding {{project-id}} --member=serviceAccount:pipeline-approver@{{project-id}}.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role=roles/clouddeploy.approver
    ```

In the long output, you should notice this output:

```terminal
- members:
  - serviceAccount:pipeline-approver@{{project-id}}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/clouddeploy.approver
```

To learn how to promote a release to a target that requires approval, click **Next**.

## Promoting to production

1. Promote your release to the prod target: 

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy releases promote --delivery-pipeline web-app --release web-app-001 --to-target prod
    ```

1. View the rollouts for `web-app-001` and notice that the promotion to prod
   has a `PENDING_APPROVAL` status:

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy rollouts list --delivery-pipeline web-app --release web-app-001
    ```

    ```terminal
    approvalState: NEEDS_APPROVAL
    createTime: '2021-05-03T17:23:18.183598192Z'
    etag: ac30600d82dcb0f
    name: projects/{{project-id}}/locations/us-central1/deliveryPipelines/web-app/releases/web-app-001/rollouts/web-app-001-to-prod-0001
    state: PENDING_APPROVAL
    target: prod
    uid: f7de1bc9af4e46e499cc0c134b3758a6
    ```

1. To approve the promotion: 

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy rollouts approve web-app-001-to-prod-0001 --delivery-pipeline web-app --release web-app-001
    ```

    After a short time, your promotion should complete.

1. To verify the promotion: 

    ```bash
    gcloud alpha deploy rollouts list --delivery-pipeline web-app --release web-app-001
    ```

    Your output should look similar to this: 

    ```terminal
    approvalState: APPROVED
    createTime: '2021-05-03T17:23:18.183598192Z'
    deployBuild: 27c9a286-2a88-419e-be5b-a79fa6248f60
    deployEndTime: '2021-05-03T19:00:26.526217Z'
    deployStartTime: '2021-05-03T18:59:46.114953201Z'
    etag: 205ff1e1a8d8c4f6
    name: projects/{{project-id}}/locations/us-central1/deliveryPipelines/web-app/releases/web-app-001/rollouts/web-app-001-to-prod-0001
    state: SUCCESS
    target: prod
    uid: f7de1bc9af4e46e499cc0c134b3758a6
    ```

1. To confirm that the app was deployed to the `prod` GKE cluster: 

    ```bash
    kubectx prod
    kubectl get pod -n default
    ```

### 🎉  Success!

You have successfully created a Cloud Deploy pipeline and promoted an application
through the test, staging, and protected production environments!

To avoid incurring charges to your account and learn about next steps
click **Next**.

## Next steps

Clean up to avoid billing charges, or keep the resources you created
and do more with Compute Engine.

### Clean up

To clean up your GKE clusters and other resources, run the cleanup script:

```bash
./cleanup.sh
```

This will remove Cloud resources and the artifacts on your
Cloud Shell instance. It may take a few minutes to complete.
